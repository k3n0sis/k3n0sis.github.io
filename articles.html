         <h2 id="Examen">The Examen</h2>
       </a>  
         <p>The prayer of Examen is the practice of reviewing the events of your day under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The process involves allowing the Holy Spirit to highlight specific moments in your day and guide you into joy, healing, forgiveness, or repentance. The ultimate goal of the practice is to see that God has been with you in all of your moments. This in turn will further facilitate welcoming Him into all of life! Don't only skip ahead to the good parts, but also don't linger on your sins or short-comings. Do keep it short. This practice should take no more than about 15 minutes.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Release:</b> Spend a few moments in silence and settle into an awareness of God's presence.</li>
             <li><b>Request:</b> Ask specifically for the Holy Spirit to guide you during your time of prayer.</li>
             <li><b>Relish:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit to bring to mind some specific gifts and graces from the day! Spend some time thanking God for them.</li>
             <li><b>Review:</b> Begin reviewing your day paying special attention to what the Holy Spirit brings to your awareness. </li>
             <li><b>Repent:</b> As you review the day you will likely come upon difficult moments: Errant words, bad attitudes, missed opportunities, selfish actions. Take time to ask forgiveness as the Holy Spirit highlights them to you.</li>
             <li><b>Resolve:</b> Based on what He has shown you, ask for God's grace to be the person He is calling you to become. Ask for grace for the things that He is asking you to do tomorrow. Resolve to be obedient.</li>

         <h2 id="Lectio-Divina">Lectio Divina</h2>
         </a>
         <p>Lectio Divina means “Divine Reading.” It is a way of meditating on the Scriptures under the guidance of the Holy Spirit such that the Scriptures master you rather than you trying to master the Scriptures. It is a way of reading that ultimately becomes a way of living. The process involves reading small portions of the Scriptures slowly, allowing the Holy Spirit to speak directly from them through an attuned awareness to words, thoughts, feelings, or images. The ultimate goal is to encounter the Living Christ in the Scriptures, see how all of Scripture points to Jesus, and to allow the Scriptures to facilitate a welcoming of Jesus into all of life. </p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Release:</b> Spend a few moments in silence and settle into an awareness of God's presence.</li>
             <li><b>Read:</b> Read slowly through the Scripture passage and pay attention to any images, words, or phrases that seem to "jump off the page" at you. Go slow.</li>
             <li><b>Reflect:</b> Read the passage again, this time paying special attention to what the Holy Spirit highlighted to you during your first read-through. Try to not over-analyze or study the passage, instead focus in on how the Holy Spirit is speaking to you using the specific thoughts, feeling, words, or images He gave you.</li>
             <li><b>Respond:</b> Read the passage once more. This time take time to respond to God in prayer based how He has been guiding you during the reading.</li>
             <li><b>Rest:</b> Now that you have responded in prayer. Take a few moments to rest silently in God's presence. When your mind wonders, gently bring it back into stillness before God.</li>

         <h2 id="Spiritual-GPS">Spiritual GPS</h2>
         </a>
         <p>This is a practice best done in conjunction with a spiritual director, however you can do this on your own. If done alone, it is recommended to undertake this as part of a longer retreat - perhaps as a weekend getaway for purposes of prayer and spiritual growth. The purpose of this exercise is to notice what has been dominating your attention lately. The process involves quietly contemplating the following questions, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, discussing the answers with your director (or journaling them if alone), and allowing the Holy Spirit to guide you into an awareness of the predominate themes of this past season. This is followed by welcoming God into them and seeking His guidance for next steps.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Release:</b> Spend a few moments in silence and settle into an awareness of God's presence.</li>
             <li><b>Situation:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ponder some of the top 2-3 facts of your life or situation.</li>
             <li><b>Thoughts:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ ponder what has been the dominate thoughts in this season of your life.</li>
             <li><b>Feelings:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ ponder what has been the dominate feelings in this season of your life.</li>
             <li><b>Body:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ ponder what has been the dominate physical condition of your body.</li>
             <li><b>Questions:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ponder the top 2-3 questions of you have been asking during this season of your life.</li>
             <li><b>Longing:</b> Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then write down/ponder what has been your strongest desires during this season of your life.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Now spend a few moments in queit. After this take some time to review what you have written down/pondered/discussed for each of these categories.</p>
         <ol>
             <li>Now ask the Holy Spirt: "What do you want me to notice in all of this? What sticks out the most or seems to 'shimmer'.</li>
             <li>Now ask the Holy Spirit to help you be open to what He is inviting you into as a result of this.</li>
             <li>Discuss your answer with your spiritual director or journal it. Make a firm commitment to obedience to do what God is asking you to do. </li>

         <h2 id="Centering-Prayer">Centering Prayer</h2>
         </a>
         <p>Centering Prayer is a form of prayer that is solely aimed at enjoying the presence of God. You simply sit in His presence without an agenda, without seeking images or ideas, and without making request. The only words you speak are a single, meaningful word drawn from Scripture or your Breath Prayer. You continually turn over your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations to God without dwelling on them or suppressing them, but rather surrendering them to Him and continually turning your focused attention back to God Himself. The goal is to dwell in Christ so that the fruit of this kind of lingering stays with us in all situations. The ultimate outcome is that we learn to trust that just attending to His presence is transformative and to reflexively turn our attention to God in the midst of our everyday activities.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Decide:</b> Choose a meaningful word from Scripture (such as Peace, My Reedemer, Stillness, Shepard, Father, Jesus, etc.) or a Breath Prayer to aid you in turning your attention to God.</li>
             <li><b>Timer: </b> When you first undertake this practice it is okay to set a timer. Start with 10 minutes and work your way up to more time.</li>
             <li><b>Settle: </b> Settle into a comfortable position, close your eyes, and say your Scriptural Word or Breath Prayer. Begin to focus on God's presence.</li>
             <li><b>Return</b> As your mind wonders, emotions stir, or bodily sensations become distracting, simply repeat your Scriptural word or Breath Prayer refocus your attention on God.</li>
             <li><b>Relish:</b> When your time is up take a moment to relish the gift and grace of God's presence.</li>

         <h2 id="Breath-Prayer">Breath Prayer</h2>
         </a>
         <p>Breath Prayers are short, 12-15 syllable prayers meant to be prayed in rhythm with your breathing. They are reflexive prayers meant to help you turn your attention to God’s presence in the midst of your daily activities, aid you in overcoming temptation, and help you return to joy in the midst of stressful situations. They consist of two parts: your most meaningful name for God (drawn from scriptural language) and either a short request or statement of praise. The exercise below can aid you crafting a Breath Prayer.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Reflect :</b> Undertaking this exercise as part of a Spiritual GPS can greatly aid you in accurately determining the following facts: What is your most meaningful name for God at this time in your life. What are you most grateful for or what do you most want Him to do in your life at this time.</li>
             <li><b>Decide: </b> Choose a meaningful name for God drawn from Scripture (such as Peace, My Redemer, Shepard, Father, Jesus, Healer, Holy One, Rock of Ages, etc.)</li>
             <li><b>Decide: </b> What is the deepest desire of your heart at this time? What do you most want to thank God for? What do you most want Him to do in your life?</li>
             <li><b>Write: </b> Write down the name and desire/praise that you have chosen. Now play with the language, crafting a short 12-15 syllable prayer.</li>
             <li><b>Practice: </b> Take a few moments with your prayer, settle in quietly, practice praying the prayer for 2 minutes. Breath in and say your name for God then breath our your praise or request.</li>
             <li><b>Timer: </b> Set an alarm on your phone for 3X times per day. When the alarm goes off, no matter what, stop and say your Breath Prayer. This will begin to build the habit of praying without ceasing.</li>

         <h2 id="Visio-Divina">Visio Divina</h2>
         </a>
         <p>Visio Divina is similar process to Lectio Divina. However, instead of meditating on a text from Scripture, you use a work of art that you find meaningful. Or you can ask the Holy Spirit to give you an image to contemplate. The Old and New Testaments both employ the use of images and metaphors to help us experience God and His ways. As we contemplate this image, we allow the Holy Spirit to speak directly from it through an attuned awareness to words, thoughts, feelings, or images.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Release: </b> Spend a few moments in silence and settle into an awareness of God's presence.</li>
             <li><b>Draw: </b>If you asked the Holy Spirt to give you an image, take the time to draw what has been shown to you.</li>
             <li><b>Gaze: </b> Spend a few moments simply gazing at the image. Familiarize yourself with it. Take in its form, color, proportions, and the overall sense of feeling that it gives you.  Begin to notice what it is about this image that really grabs your attention. Ask the Holy Spirit for guidance.</li>
             <li><b>Reflect: </b> Write down your answers to these questions. What stands out to you the most about this image? What feeling and emotions are you experiencing as you gaze on this image? What about this image is connected to your current life circumstances?</li>
             <li><b>Reflect: </b> Ask Jesus: What is it that you want to show me? Is there anything you want to say to me? Write down what He tells you.</li>
             <li><b>Respond: </b> Write down a prayer as a response to what God has shown you. Commit to being obedient and ask the Holy Spirit to help you.</li>
             <li><b>Rest: </b> Now that you have responded in prayer take a few moments to rest silently in God's presence. When your mind wonders, gently bring it back into stillness before God.</li>

         <h2 id="Kingdom-Prayer">Kingdom Prayer</h2>
         </a>
         <p>We are transformed not only in the solitude of our prayer closest, but also out in the street as we join God in what He is doing in the people's lives around us. Kingdom Prayer is about partnering with the Holy Spirit in "doing the stuff" of God's Kingdom. Expect God to show up and transform people's lives as you lovingly notice how He is at work and join Him in it.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Notice: </b>First take time to notice if there is any resistance within yourself to the possibility of God performing a supernatural act for your neighbor today. If there is, spend sometime in prayer asking God to release you from that. </li>
             <li><b>Pray: </b>Ask the Holy Spirit to help you notice the people and situations that He is inviting you to pray about.</li>
             <li><b>Ask: </b>When God highlights a person or issue to you, approach them and simply ask them if you can pray for them about that.</li>
             <li><b>Discern: </b>If the person responds, ask them how they came to have this issue. At the same time ask the Holy Spirit to help you discern how to pray for this issue.</li>
             <li><b>Select: </b>Based on what the Holy Spirit revealed and what the person said, pray simply and directly about that issue. Boldly ask for healing, deliverance, justice, restitution, or reconciliation.</li>
             <li><b>Dialogue: </b> <b>Always ask permission </b> before physically touching someone, such as putting your hand on their shoulder in a gesture of solidarity. Pray with your eyes open, looking for signs that the God is answering your prayer. After an initial round of prayer ask the person how they are feeling, thinking, or doing. If you noticed something, or received a scripture or image, ask God if you should share that with them or if you should keep that to yourself to pray silently about. If you do share tell them what you saw without commentary and ask them what they think about that. Don't interpret it for them. Offer to keep praying with them if they would like. </li>
             <li><b>Direct: </b>After you are done praying offer post-prayer instruction. For instance, if they feel like they were healed, tell them to get confirmation with a medical professional. Direct them to a Christian fellowship for follow-up. Encourage them to document what God has done for them.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Praying for supernatural works of God in people's lives can feel very daunting. A thousand "what-ifs" are likely to surface in your heart and mind. The only way onward in this type of prayer is through. The best way to get it started is to remember that you are a student of the Kingdom under the tender guidance and care of the living Christ. Simply start. <b>Do this as you can, not as you can't.</b> Overtime and many hundreds of prayers like this, you will find your expectation for the work of God in your life and in others lives grow. You will be transformed as you partner with the Holy Spirit in the supernatural work that only He can do. </p>

        <h2 id="Attending-Children">Attending Children</h2>
        </a>
        <p>In Matthew 18 we see an astonishing scene unfold. Jesus’s disciples are engaged in a debate over who will be the greatest and ask Jesus to settle the matter for them. Jesus asked one of the nearby children to come and stand in the midst of his disciples. And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <i>And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.</i></p>
        <p>The word “welcome” in the original language of the Scriptures is <I>dechomai</I>. Dechomai essentially means to display a deep, attentive, thoughtful, warm hospitality. It means to receive someone and thoroughly attend to their needs. Notice that this attentive hospitality extended to children comes with a starling proclamation. <i>And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.</i> To undertake purposeful welcoming of children is to also welcome the very presence of the Living Christ!</p>
        <p>Such an undertaking is not a matter of gifting, or even a specific calling. It is simply a matter of desire. A desire to be with Jesus where He is and to participate with Him in what He is already doing.  Attending to children is a pathway to personal transformation through participating with Jesus is loving and serving the vulnerable among us.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Discern: </b> Ask the Holy Spirit for discernment. If you notice that there is resistance, ask the Holy Spirit to show you God’s heart for children. Ask for God’s emotions to be give you. Ask for God’s thoughts to be given you. </li>
            <li><b>Pray: </b>Ask the Holy Spirit what He is inviting you into with regard to attending and serving children.</li>
            <li><b>Notice: </b>Notice what your heart seems to be drawn to. Is it serving in the church nursery? Would you enjoy coaching a youth sports event? Perhaps you might notice a passion for after-school tutoring, or a desire to share a skill or passion that you have? If nothing immediatley comes to mind, yet you still have a desire to participate in this discipline, ask the Holy Spirit to help you be attentive to what He wants to invite you into over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li><b>Ask: </b>Once you have discerned the invitation, approach the leaders and ask how you might join. Inquire about the training, background checks, and time commitments.</li>
            <li><b>Intercede: </b>As you begin attending to these children ask the Holy Spirt to help you notice how He is at work in their lives. How can you join Him in that work? How can you intercede for them? What sorts of questions and passions are preoccupying their hearts and minds?</li>

        <h2 id="Serving-The-Poor">Serving The Poor</h2>
        </a>
        <p>In the book of Galatians the Apostle Paul recounts his meeting with the some the leaders of the early church. He states "All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I had been eager to do all along." God's concern for the poor is at the very heart of the Good News and has a primary emphasis in the announcement of the present reality Kingdom of God.</p>
        <p>Jesus himself came to us as one of the poor, powerless, and disenfranchised. The Church has long remembered this state of affairs, and in compassion and solidarity with our Lord, moved to give of her time, energy, attention, and material goods to alleviate the suffering of the poor, and work for justice and reconciliation among the powerless and disenfranchised. </p>
        <p>We lean toward the lost, the poor, the outcast, and the outsider with the compassion of Jesus as sinners whose only standing before God is utterly dependent on the mercy of God. This mercy can only be truly received inasmuch as we are willing to give it away. We do so not because we believe we are better than them, or because we believe we can fix them. We lean toward the poor, the outcast, and the outsider because we ourselves have experienced the kindness and mercy of God.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Discern: </b> Ask the Holy Spirit for discernment. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you God’s heart for poor among you. Ask for God’s emotions to be given you. Ask for God’s thoughts to be given you.</li>
            <li><b>Pray: </b>Ask the Holy Spirit what He is inviting you into with regard to serving the poor.</li>
            <li><b>Notice: </b>Service to the poor is always most formative when done in proximity to your current context and life circumstances. Think about your current context: the places you live, work, play, or go to school. Notice where your heart seems to be drawn to in these context. If nothing immediately comes to mind, yet you still have a desire to participate in this discipline, ask the Holy Spirit to help you be attentive to what He wants to invite you into over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li><b>Ask: </b>It is very likely that someone or some organization is already serving in this area. Approach the leadership and ask about training and time commitments. If nothing is currently being done to address the situation, ask God how He is inviting you to get involved and what He wants you to do. Go slow, ask questions, and listen carefully. Converse with the people in the situation you feel drawn to and ask them what they want and need rather than trying to impose a solution.</li>
            <li><b>Intercede: </b>As you begin attending to your neighbors ask the Holy Spirt to help you notice how He is at work in their lives. How can you join Him in that work? How can you intercede for them? What sorts of questions, concerns, and passions are preoccupying their hearts and minds?</li>

        <h2 id="Fasting">Fasting</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Fasting is the spiritual discipline of restraining or abstaining from eating in order to gain something spiritually. What is central to the fast is the idea of humbling ourselves through self-denial. Fasting is a voluntary weakness. It is a discipline that has deep Scriptural roots and a long history in the Church. </p>
        <p>Fasting is also very much about how you respond when you do not get what you want. Noticing these responses and taking them to God in prayer can serve to deepen our relationship with Him. In addition to this, going without food often places us into a more profound state of realizing our dependence on God, and can foster an attitude of deeper trust in Him.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Consult: </b>Before undertaking this discipline please consult a medical professional to determine if you can undertake this safely. Also give thorough consideration to the type of job that you have and your body's needs if you have a physically demanding job.</li>
            <li><b>Begin Small: </b>It is important to begin this by taking small steps. Like all of these practices, you should do them as you can, not as you can't. At first, consider starting with skipping one meal. Consider doing this consistently on the same day and at the same time for a few weeks before lengthening the fast.    </li>
            <li><b>During The Fast: </b> Spend the time that you would normally have spent eating in worship, intercession, or one of the other practices listed here such as Lectio Divina or The Examen.</li>
            <li><b>Notice: </b>Ask the Holy Spirit to help you notice your physical state, your emotions, and how you are responding to the situation. Ask Him to help you respond well and to help you grow in your dependence on Him.</li>
            <li><b>Breaking The Fast: </b>When you break the fast avoid fatty or sugary foods, large meals in general, and dairy. Start with a small snack and wait a bit before eating more until you know how your body responds to coming off a fast.</li>
            <li><b>Lengthen The Time: </b>Once you are accustomed to skipping a single meal, consider fasting for 24 hours on a regular basis such as from lunch one day until lunch the next day. You may eventually decide to periodically lengthen your fast to three or more days.</li>

        <h2 id="Silence">Silence and Stillness</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The Scriptures, and in particular the Psalms, are filled with references of silence and stillness. Silence, it has been said, is God's first language. Indeed, it was out of silence that the Lord lovingly spoke to create all things. Likewise, we find many examples of people waiting in silence and stillness before God for comfort, for answers, for direction. When life is marked by great tragedy sometimes the only response is silence and stillness such as when Job's friends arrived after the death of his family and simply sat with him for seven days and nights. Silence and stillness can be profound, and can speak for us when we do not know what to say. </p>
        <p>Psalm after psalm extols the virtue of this practice. For instance in Psalms 62: "For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation...For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken." Or take Psalms 131: "But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me." </p>
        <p>Theologian and priest Ronald Rolheiser notes that "Our age constitutes a virtual conspiracy against interior life. Historical circumstance … is conspiring to produce a climate within which it is difficult to think about God, pray, or have any interior depth. The air we breathe today is not conducive to interiority and depth...In the Western world, most of us have an atrophied contemplative ability. We are skilled in critical assessment, analytical reasoning, linear thought, and logical processing. Still, we are on unfamiliar ground regarding reflection, meditation, intuitive listening, and prayer full discerning. God is present with us, but we are oblivious to that presence." The reclamation and practice of these disciplines can aid us in the midst of busy lives to connect deeply with the God who loves us and wants to share His very life with us right where we are.</p>

            <li><b>Discover: </b>Silence and stillness can be difficult to come by depending on your life circumstances and responsibilities. Yet there is almost always at least small periods of time when you might purposefully engage in this practice. On a commute, between meetings, while doing the dishes, or after dinner. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you the moments that are available to you to begin engaging in this practice. Capture these small moments to begin practicing stillness and silence.</li>
            <li><b>Pause: </b>When the time comes, simply pause and become suddenly present to God who is always present to you.</li>
            <li><b>Connect: </b>Take a moment to connect with God. Breath Prayer in particular is a powerful initiator. As you quiet your mind and still your body, simply pray your breath prayer. Then stop and give your complete attention to God.</li>
            <li><b>Enjoy: </b>Before moving back into activity, take a brief second to thank God for His presence and for whatever else you might be grateful for. Endeavor to carry that awareness of God with you into the next activity. </li>

        <h2 id="Solitude">Solitude</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The Gospel of Luke notes that Jesus experienced a sharp rise in ministerial activity after news of his life, message, and miracles begin to spread. In the midst of this ministerial business and "success", Luke remarks that "the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. But Jesus would often slip away to the wilderness to pray." Observed frequently in the life of Jesus, we see this practice of withdrawing from busy spaces and people for times of solitude."</p>
        <p>An American theologian named Dallas Willard notes the power of this practice when he states: "Solitude well practiced will break the power of busyness, haste, isolation, and loneliness. You will see that the world is not on your shoulders after all. You will find yourself, and God will find you in new ways." It was precisely this practice that allowed Jesus to deeply experience God's love for Him, to be so fully present and attentive to the needs around Him, and to discern how His Father was at work so that He could join Him in it.</p>
        <p>After all, to spend some time in solitude is not to be alone, but to create space to notice and respond to the God who is always present to you, who deeply loves you, and who desires to share His thoughts, feelings, even His very Kingdom with you in the here and now.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Discover: </b>At various times and in various seasons, solitude can be difficult to come by depending on your life circumstances and responsibilities. Yet there is almost always at least some periods of time when you might purposefully engage in this practice. On a commute, between meetings, or after the kids are in bed. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you the moments that are available to you to begin engaging in this practice.</li>
            <li><b>Plan: </b>Solitude rarely or never happens without intentionally planning for it. It may be best to begin with setting aside small 10-15 minute increments in your day for solitude. However, begin making deliberate steps towards spending more time in solitude. As with all of these practices: Do this as you can, not as you can't.</li>
            <li><b>Connect: </b>During your time of solitude do those things which help you connect most deeply with your Heavenly Father. Breath prayers, journaling, Lectio Divina, reading scriptures, or centering prayer may be profitable during this time. Or perhaps you just want to go for a stroll and have a conversation with God, or simply notice what is going on around you in conjunction with God. Perhaps you want to sit in silence.</li>
            <li><b>Full Day Retreat </b>Eventually you may practice your way into longer periods of solitude. A full day retreat undertaken once every 3 months can do wonders for your life with God and other people. Please see the additional resources section for a sample schedule of how to spend an intentional day in solitude.</li>

         <h2 id="ExamenP">Oração do Exame</h2>
       </a>  
         <p>A oração do Exame é a prática de revisar os eventos do seu dia sob a orientação do Espírito Santo. O processo envolve permitir que o Espírito Santo destaque momentos específicos do seu dia e o guie para a alegria, cura, perdão ou arrependimento. O objetivo final da prática é perceber que Deus esteve com você em todos os seus momentos. Isso, por sua vez, facilitará ainda mais recebê-Lo em toda a sua vida! Não pule apenas para as partes boas, mas também não se detenha em seus pecados ou falhas. Mantenha-A curta. Essa prática não deve levar mais do que cerca de 15 minutos.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Libertação:</b> Dedique alguns momentos em silêncio e se conscientize da presença de Deus.</li>
             <li><b>Pedido:</b> Peça especificamente ao Espírito Santo que o guie durante o tempo de oração.</li>
             <li><b>Desfrutar:</b> Peça ao Espírito Santo que traga à mente alguns dons e graças específicos do dia! Dedique um tempo agradecendo a Deus por eles.</li>
             <li><b>Revisão:</b> Comece a revisar seu dia, prestando atenção especial ao que o Espírito Santo traz à sua consciência.</li>
             <li><b>Arrependimento:</b> Ao revisar o dia, você provavelmente encontrará momentos difíceis: palavras erradas, atitudes ruins, oportunidades perdidas, ações egoístas. Dedique tempo para pedir perdão conforme o Espírito Santo os destaca para você.</li>
             <li><b>Resolução:</b> Com base no que Ele lhe mostrou, peça a graça de Deus para ser a pessoa que Ele está chamando você a ser. Peça graça para as coisas que Ele está pedindo para você fazer amanhã. Resolva ser obediente.</li>

        <h2 id="Lectio-DivinaP">Lectio Divina</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Lectio Divina significa "Leitura Divina". É uma maneira de meditar nas Escrituras sob a orientação do Espírito Santo, de modo que as Escrituras o dominem, em vez de você tentar dominar as Escrituras. É uma forma de leitura que, em última instância, se torna uma maneira de viver. O processo envolve a leitura de pequenas porções das Escrituras lentamente, permitindo que o Espírito Santo fale diretamente por meio delas, por meio de uma consciência ajustada às palavras, pensamentos, sentimentos ou imagens. O objetivo final é encontrar o Cristo Vivo nas Escrituras, ver como toda a Escritura aponta para Jesus e permitir que as Escrituras facilitem a acolhida de Jesus em toda a vida.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Libertação:</b> Dedique alguns momentos em silêncio e entre em sintonia com a presença de Deus.</li>
            <li><b>Leia:</b> Leia lentamente o trecho das Escrituras e preste atenção a quaisquer imagens, palavras ou frases que pareçam "saltar da página" para você. Vá devagar.</li>
            <li><b>Reflexão:</b> Leia o trecho novamente, desta vez prestando atenção especial ao que o Espírito Santo destacou para você durante a primeira leitura. Tente não analisar demais ou estudar o trecho, em vez disso, concentre-se em como o Espírito Santo está falando com você usando os pensamentos, sentimentos, palavras ou imagens específicas que Ele lhe deu.</li>
            <li><b>Resposta:</b> Leia o trecho mais uma vez. Desta vez, reserve um tempo para responder a Deus em oração com base em como Ele tem guiado você durante a leitura.</li>
            <li><b>Descanso:</b> Agora que você respondeu em oração, tire alguns momentos para descansar silenciosamente na presença de Deus. Quando sua mente divagar, traga-a suavemente de volta à quietude diante de Deus.</li>

         </a>
         <p>Esta é uma prática que é melhor realizada em conjunto com um diretor espiritual, no entanto, você pode fazê-la sozinho. Se feito sozinho, é recomendável realizar isso como parte de um retiro mais longo - talvez como uma escapada de fim de semana com propósitos de oração e crescimento espiritual. O objetivo deste exercício é notar o que tem dominado sua atenção ultimamente. O processo envolve contemplar silenciosamente as seguintes perguntas, sob a orientação do Espírito Santo, discutir as respostas com seu diretor (ou escrevê-las em um diário, se estiver sozinho) e permitir que o Espírito Santo o guie para uma consciência dos temas predominantes este período passado em sua vida. Isso é seguido por acolher Deus neles e buscar Sua orientação para os próximos passos.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><b>Libertação:</b> Dedique alguns momentos em silêncio e entre em sintonia com a presença de Deus.</li>
             <li><b>Situação:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre os principais 2-3 fatos de sua vida ou situação.</li>
             <li><b>Pensamentos:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre quais têm sido os pensamentos dominantes nesta temporada de sua vida.</li>
             <li><b>Sentimentos:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre quais têm sido os sentimentos dominantes nesta temporada de sua vida.</li>
             <li><b>Corpo:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre qual tem sido a condição física dominante do seu corpo.</li>
             <li><b>Perguntas:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre as principais 2-3 perguntas que você tem feito durante esta temporada de sua vida.</li>
             <li><b>Desejos:</b> Peça orientação ao Espírito Santo e, em seguida, escreva/reflita sobre quais têm sido seus desejos mais fortes durante esta temporada de sua vida.</li>
             
             <p>Agora, dedique alguns momentos em silêncio. Depois disso, reserve um tempo para revisar o que você escreveu/refletiu/discutiu para cada uma dessas categorias.</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Agora, pergunte ao Espírito Santo: "O que você quer que eu perceba em tudo isso? O que se destaca mais ou parece 'brilhar'."</li>
                 <li>Agora, peça ao Espírito Santo que o ajude a estar aberto ao que Ele está convidando você a fazer como resultado disso.</li>
                 <li>Discuta sua resposta com seu diretor espiritual ou escreva-a em um diário. Comprometa-se firmemente a obedecer ao que Deus está pedindo que você faça.</li>
